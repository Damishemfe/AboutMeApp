        When I visited JetBrains for the first time in Spring 2010, I came in fairly certain that
the world didn’t need another general-purpose programming language. I thought
that existing JVM languages were good enough, and who in their right mind creates a
new language anyway? After about an hour discussing production issues in large-scale
codebases I was convinced otherwise, and the first ideas that later became part of Kotlin
were sketched on a whiteboard. I joined JetBrains shortly after to lead the design
of the language and work on the compiler.</string>
